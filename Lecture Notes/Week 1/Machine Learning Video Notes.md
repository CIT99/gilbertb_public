# Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI Video Notes

The segment of the machine learning video that we viewed discussed the topic of how AI is effecting our society. It first covers some cons of what AI is being used to do today such as deep fakes. These AIs were originally created for the film industry in order to assist with character creation but it has been found to be useful in creating fake videos of high profile people.
Other possible misuse of of machine learning include using AI to monitor us, create filter bubbles, sell our personal info, and use facial recognition to track us.

Of course AI is also being used to improve our society by helping people too. In the video for example machine learning was used to help a lady who's vison was impaired. AI can also be used extensively in other areas such as autonomous cars and managing airplanes and UAVs. There are many uses for AI that can improve how we live our lives. Its our job to go out there and make it happen.
