# Sec 1 Solving Machine Learning Problems

This video is showing us an example of a machine learning problem.

## Problem

We are an analyst at a city with big flooding problem. We are given the question "If it rains 240mm this year, how much flood damage will there be?"

## Problem Solving Steps

1. Identify relevant data to the problem
2. Assemble datasets related to our problem
3. Figure out what kind of output we want
4. Based on the output pick an algorithm that will find the correlation between our features and our labels
5. use the model from our algorithm to make a prediction
