# Week 2 notes

## Section 3

In this section we cover the basics of the Tensorflow library.

1. The difference between Shape and Dimension
2. Elementwise operations
3. Broadcasting operations
4. Displaying and accessing tensor data
    * For instance slicing data with the slice method
    * syntax: `tf.data.slice([index_R, index_C],[size_R, size_C])`
5. Modifying tensors by concatenation and summing elements

## Section 4

In this section we implement our KNN algorithm again but using tensorflow
