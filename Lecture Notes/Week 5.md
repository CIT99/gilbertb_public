# Natural Binary Classification

In this section we looked at a classification type problem. Instead of using linear regression like we did before since we had a continous output, we have to use logistic regression.

logistic regression is very similar to linear regression. The only things that change are our cost function and the use of the Sigmoid (logistics) function.
