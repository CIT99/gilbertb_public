# A Complete Walkthrough

In this video we discuss two diffrent types of outputs that we can get.

## Output Types

The two main types of outputs that we will be looking at throughout this course is Classification and Regrestion.

### Classification

 It is what we use when our lables are discrete for example looking at a picture and checking if it is of a dog or a cat.

### Regression

It is what we use when our lables are continous for example say we have a picture of a face and we want the x and y cordinates of where the nose is. Those outputs could range from anywhere in the picture so it is continous.

For predicting the amount of flood damage based on the amount of rain fall we going to be using a regression type algorithm

## Problem Solving Process

1. Identify relevant data to the problem
    * Features are catagories of data pionts that affect the value of a Label
2. Assemble datasets related to our problem
    * Datasets almost always need cleaning up or formatting
3. Figure out what kind of output we want
    * Regression used with continous values
    * Classification used with discrete values
4. Based on the output pick an algorithm that will find the correlation between our features and our labels
    * There are many diffent algorithms that exist
5. use the model from our algorithm to make a prediction
    * Models relate the value of our features to the value our labels
