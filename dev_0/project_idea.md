# Dev Zero

For my dev zero project I would like to use a nueral network to identify the position of a small drone in a camera feed. The project will be based of the nvida jetson nano geting started image regression tutorial. The framework being used is pytorch and the model being resnet18

## Progress 11/24/19

I have managed to create my data collection routine, my own data labeling system and I've created a trainig function and began training my model on my limited dataset.

I need to gather more data and There is a bug in my trainig funtion that I must find.
